    <h3>A comparison of approaches</h3>
    <p><b>Background</b></p>
    <p>Now, we've seen the constructions of regular expressions and finite automata for the purpose of recognizing regular languages.</p>
    <p><b>Comparison</b></p>
    <p>The following table illustrates a comparison between approaches:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Regular expression</th>
        <th>DFA</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Concise to express in written form</td>
        <td>Is best expressed as a diagram</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Recognition is hard, as it requires deep inspection and mental trial / error</td>
        <td>Recognition is straightforward and easy to construct</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></n></p>
    <p>Because regular expressions are easier to express in written (string) form, but harder to use directly to recognize strings, we will need some way to convert a regular expression into a finite automaton. We will subsequently show this construction and will also show that DFAs are as expressive as NFAs and &epsilon;-NFAs in terms of the languages they recognize.</p>
