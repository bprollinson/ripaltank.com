    <h2>Regular expressions</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>In order to define a regular language in a concise way, we can use a regular expression.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Base symbols</h3>
      <p>Similar to in our definition of a regular language, for any alphabet &Sigma;, we can construct R = &epsilon; as a regular expression.</p>
      <p>Similarly, for an &sigma; &isin; &Sigma;, we can construct R = &sigma; as a regular expression.</p>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {}</p>
        <p>R = &epsilon;<p>
        <p>This regular expression recognizes the empty string &epsilon;.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a}</p>
        <p>R = a</p>
        <p>This regular expression recognizes the string a.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Concatenation of expressions</h3>
      <p>We want to allow for the inclusion of strings consisting of multiple symbols in our regular language. In order to support this, we want to allow the concatenation (squishing together) of two expressions to create a more complex expression. This is exactly matches the concatenation operator as described in our definition of regular languages.</p>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b}</p>
        <p>We know that R<sub>1</sub> = {a} and R<sub>2</sub> = {b} are regular expressions.</p>
        <p>R = R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub> = ab</p>
        <p>This regular expression recognizes the string ab.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Union of expressions</h3>
      <p>We want to allow for the choice of two expressions in our regular language. In order to support this, we want to allow the union ("or" operation) of two expressions to create a more complex expression.  This exactly matches the union operator as described in our definition of regular languages.</p>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b}</p>
        <p>We know that R<sub>1</sub> = {a} and R<sub>2</sub> = {b} are regular expressions.</p>
        <p>R = R<sub>1</sub> &cup; R<sub>2</sub> = a &cup; b</p>
        <p>This regular expression recognizes the strings a and b.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Kleene closure of an expression</h3>
      <p>We want to allow the repetition of expressions in our regular language. In order to support this, we want to allow the Kleene closure (*) operator to be applied to an expression to create a more complex expression. This exactly matches the Kleene closure operator as described in our definition of regular languages.</p>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a}</p>
        <p>We know that R<sub>1</sub> = {a} is a regular expression.</p>
        <p>R = R<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup> = a<sup>*</sup>
        <p>This regular expression recognizes the strings &epsilon;, a, aa, ..., with no limit on the string length.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Special case: The empty language</h3>
      <p>We should include a representation of the empty language, since that is a valid regular language as described in our definition. We can represent it with a special symbol as follows:</p>
      <p>R = &oslash;</p>
      <p>This regular expression never recognizes any string and allows us to reprsent the empty set of strings which corresponds to the language:</p>
      <p>L = {}</p>
    </div>
