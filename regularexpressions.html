    <h3>Regular expressions</h3>
    <p><b>Background</b></p>
    <p>In order to formally define a regular language in a concise way, we can use a regular expression.</p>
    <p><b>Base symbols</b></p>
    <p>We will start with declaring that, for any alphabet &Sigma;, R = &epsilon; is a regular expression.</p>
    <p>Similarly, we will declare that, for an &sigma; &isin; &Sigma;, R = &sigma; is a regular expression.</p>
    <p><i>Examples</i></p>
    <p>&Sigma; = {}</p>
    <p>R = &epsilon;<p>
    <p>This regular expression recognizes the empty string &epsilon;.</p>
    <p>&Sigma; = {a}</p>
    <p>R = a</p>
    <p>This regular expression recognizes the string a.</p>
    <p><b>Concatenation of expressions</b></p>
    <p>We want to allow for the inclusion of strings consisting of multiple symbols in our regular language. In order to support this, we want to allow the concatenation (squishing together) of two grammars to create a more complex grammar.</p>
    <p><i>Example</i></p>
    <p>&Sigma; = {a, b}</p>
    <p>We know that R<sub>1</sub> = {a} and R<sub>2</sub> = {b} are regular expressions.</p>
    <p>R = R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub> = ab</p>
    <p>This regular expression recognizes the string ab.</p>
    <p><b>Union of expressions</b></p>
    <p>We want to allow for the choice of two expressions in our regular language. In order to support this, we want to allow the union ("or" operation) of two grammars to create a more complex grammar.</p>
    <p><i>Example</i></p>
    <p>&Sigma; = {a, b}</p>
    <p>We know that R<sub>1</sub> = {a} and R<sub>2</sub> = {b} are regular expressions.</p>
    <p>R = R<sub>1</sub> &cup; R<sub>2</sub> = a &cup; b</p>
    <p>This regular expression recognizes the strings a and b.</p>
    <p><b>Kleene closure of an expression</b></p>
    <p>We want to allow the repretition of expressions in our regular language. In order to support this, we want to allow the Kleene closure (*) operator to be applied to a grammar to create a more complex grammar.</p>
    <p>&Sigma; = {a}</p>
    <p>We know that R<sub>1</sub> = {a} is a regular expression.</p>
    <p>R = R<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup>
    <p>This regular expression recognizes the strings &epsilon;, a, aa, ..., with no limit on the string length.</p>
