    <h2>Bottom-up parsing motivations</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>We've explored top-down parsing via the LL(1) parsing algorithm. Next, we will explore the concepts behind bottom-up parsing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Bottom-up parsing</h3>
      <div class="subsection definition">
        <p><em>Definition</em></p>
        <p>In a bottom-up parsing procedure for context-free languages, we attempt to recognize string s as part of language L using grammar G. To do so, we start with s, the string to be accepted, and apply a sequence of productions {p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub>} in reverse to reduce s to start symbol S.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b, c}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; AB<br/>
          A &rarr; a<br/>
          B &rarr; b<br/>
          B &rarr; bc
        </p>
        <p>The following reverse derivation of the string abc corresponds to a bottom-up parsing procedure:</p>
        <div class="derivation">abc
&rarr; Abc (via rule 2)
&rarr; AB (via rule 4)
&rarr; S (via rule 1)</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Production choice</h3>
      <p>Similar to in top-down parsing, decisions on which production to use need to be made by the parser.</p>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>When we have produced Abc and are looking to reduce the terminals b and c, we have two possible rules that could be applied:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>B &rarr; b</li>
          <li>B &rarr; bc</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>Because we have b and c in our input string, we would choose rule 4 in this case.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>A dead end</h3>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b, c}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; AC<br/>
          A &rarr; ab<br/>
          C &rarr; cc
        </p>
        <p>Let's say we have the input string abc and try to derive it (in reverse) using this grammar:</p>
        <div class="derivation">abc
&rarr; Ac (via rule 2)</div>
        <p>Here, we choose to apply rule 2 since it matches nonterminals a and b which appear at the beginning of our input string. However, the single terminal c doesn't match the output of any production in our grammar. The above is not a valid derivation of abc, which is in fact not part of the specified language.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Ambiguity</h3>
      <p>Similar to top-down parsers, bottom-up parsers may encounter ambiguous situations when trying to match an input string to a language specification.</p>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; aa<br/>
          S &rarr; ab
        </p>
        <p>Deriving the string ab in reverse:</p>
        <div class="derivation">ab
&rarr; S (via rule 2)</div>
        <p>In this example, looking at the first input symbol a is not enough to decide which production should be used to reduce the input symbols to a nonterminal. Here, we have to look ahead to the next symbol, b, to determine that rule 2 is the correct rule to apply.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; a<br/>
          S &rarr; a
        </p>
        <p>Deriving the string a in reverse:</p>
        <div class="derivation">a
&rarr; S (via rule ?)</div>
        <p>Similar to in top-down parsing, we know that a is part of our language. However, we can't determine its meaning because it's not clear which production should be used to derive a. This language is ambiguous.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>We now have a basic understanding of what bottom-up parsing is. Next, we will look at the parsing actions that are used by LR parsers - a common type of bottom-up parsers.</p>
