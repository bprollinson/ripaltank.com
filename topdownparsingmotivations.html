    <h2>Top-down parsing motivations</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>We've seen how context-free grammars can be used to derive strings as part of a context-free language. Next, we will informally introduce some of the concepts needed to construct and utilize the simplest of all context-free language parsers - the LL(1) parser.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
    <h3>Top-down parsing</h3>
      <div class="subsection definition">
        <p><em>Definition</em></p>
        <p>In a top-down parsing procedure for context-free languages, we attempt to recognize string s as part of language L using grammar G. To do so, we start with S, the start symbol for G and apply a sequence of productions {p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub>} such that S &rarr;<sup>*</sup> s.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>All previous examples of context-free derivations followed this top-down approach. Regardless, here's another example:</p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b, c}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; ACD<br/>
          A &rarr; ab<br/>
          A &rarr; b<br/>
          C &rarr; c<br/>
          D &rarr; dE<br/>
          E &rarr; e
        </p>
        <p>The following derivation of the string abcde corresponds to a top-down parsing procedure:</p>
        <p>
          S<br/>
          &rarr; ACD (via rule 1)<br/>
          &rarr; abCD (via rule 2)<br/>
          &rarr; abcD (via rule 4)<br/>
          &rarr; abcdE (via rule 5)<br/>
          &rarr; abcde (via rule 6)
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Intuitive explanation</h3>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>When we have produced ACD and are looking to expand the non-terminal A, we have two possible rules that could be applied:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A &rarr; ab</li>
          <li>A &rarr; b</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because the next symbol in our input string is a, we choose to use the rule whose right side begins with the terminal a. We choose rule 2 over rule 3 in this case.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Handling subsequent non-terminals</h3>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b, c}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; AB<br/>
          A &rarr; a<br/>
          B &rarr; bc<br/>
          B &rarr; cc 
        </p>
        <p>Let's derive the string acc:</p>
        <p>
          S<br/>
          &rarr; AB (via rule 1)<br/>
          aB (via rule 2)<br/>
          acc (via rule 4)
        </p>
        <p>Here, we apply rule 4 rather than rule 3 for our final production because the remaining input that has not yet been produced (cc) better matches that production.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
    <h3>Looking deeper through multiple productions</h3>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {x, y, z}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; AZ<br/>
          A &rarr; B<br/>
          A &rarr; C<br/>
          B &rarr; x<br/>
          C &rarr; y<br/>
          Z &rarr; z
        </p>
        <p>Let's derive the string yz:</p>
        <p>
          S<br/>
          &rarr; AZ (via rule 1)<br/>
          &rarr; CZ (via rule 3)<br/>
          &rarr; yZ (via rule 5)<br/>
          &rarr; yz (via rule 6)
        </p>
        <p>When we have produced AZ and are looking to expand the non-terminal A, we choose rule 3 because C &rarr;<sup>*</sup> y. This line of thinking can be used for even longer non-terminal chains.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>A dead end</h3>
      <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; A<br/>
          A &rarr; ab
        </p>
        <p>Let's say we have the input string aa and we try to derive it using this grammar:</p>
        <p>
          S<br/>
          &rarr; A (via rule 1)<br/>
          &rarr; ab (via rule 2)
        </p>
        <p>Here, we chose to apply rule 1 because it looks like rule 2 subequently procudes the a symbol we need. However, it causes a mismatch later in the string. The above is not a valid derivation of aa, which is in fact not part of the specified language.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Ambiguity</h3>
        <div class="subsection example">
        <p><em>Example</em></p>
        <p>&Sigma; = {a, b}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; aa<br/>
          S &rarr; ab
        </p>
        <p>Let's derive the string ab:</p>
        <p>
          S<br/>
          &rarr; ab (via rule 2)
        </p>
        <p>Here, we choose to apply rule 2 because although the first input character (a) would be matched in either case, the second input character (b) would only be matched via rule 2. As shown here, sometimes we need to look more than one symbol ahead to decide how to produce our input string via context-free grammar rules.</p>
        <p>&Sigma; {a}</p>
        <p>
          S &rarr; a<br/>
          S &rarr; a
        </p>
        <p>Let's say we have the input string a and we try to derive it using this grammar:</p>
        <p>
          S<br/>
          a (via rule ?)
        </p>
        <p>Even though a is clearly in our language, it's not clear which production rule should be used. As a result of this, it's not clear what the input string means in this language provided by the CFG. This grammar is ambiguous.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Hopefully, this page introduced you to some of the motivations of digging deeper into the details of top-down parsing algorithms. Specific information on these algorithms will be provided subsequently.</p>
