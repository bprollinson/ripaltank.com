    <h3>What is parsing?</h3>
    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Parsing is a process whereby an input string can be tested for membership in a language.</p>
    <p>Parsing attempts to answer two primary questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Does the input string belong to the language?</li>
      <li>If so, what does it mean?</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Examples</b></p>
    <p>L = {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | n >= 1}</p>
    <p>Does 000111 belong to L? Yes.</p>
    <p>What does it mean? 000111 is produced by the langhage specification when n = 3.</p>
    <p>Does 00011 belong to L? No.</p>
    <p>L = {subject verb object | subject, verb, object are valid English words or phrses of the appropriate type}</p>
    <p>Does "The man threw the ball" belong to the language? Yes.</p>
    <p>What does it mean? "The man" is the subject, "threw" is the verb and "the ball" is the object.</p>
